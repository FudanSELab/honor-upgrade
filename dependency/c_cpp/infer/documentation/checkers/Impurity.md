This is an experimental inter-procedural analysis that detects impure functions. It is meant to be an improvement over the [purity](/docs/next/checker-purity) analysis with a negation on the issue types. For each function, impurity analysis keeps track of not only the impurity of the function but also some additional information such as which parameters/globals the function modifies. It models functions with no summary/model as impure. The analysis relies on [Pulse](/docs/next/checker-pulse) summaries to determine impurity.
