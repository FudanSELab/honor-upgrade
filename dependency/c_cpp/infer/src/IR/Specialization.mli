(** Summary specialization is a technique that permits to increase the precision of summary by
    specializing them to calling context. Each analysis can choose its notion of specialization. The
    interprocedural engine will reanalyze a procedure if it needs specialization and it will add the
    obtained specialized summary to the summaries stored for this procedure. This techique avoids
    cloning procedures. *)
