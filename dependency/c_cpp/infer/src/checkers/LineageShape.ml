                        [map_value] is [Some S'], then S = S'. Also [map_value] is [None] iff all
                        seen map accesses use known atoms as keys.

                        Explanation follows.

                        If a vector semantically has at last one key which cannot be statically
                        determined as a constant atom, then we assume that accessing key may access
                        all map-keys of that vector.

                        In that case all the map keys of the vector must have the same shape, that
                        is, all the atom-map-keys that we keep track of. We thus set [map_value] to
                        that unified shape, and all further map-value shapes will be unified to it.

                        That doesn't concern fieldname keys: if a vector-shaped variable can be
                        either a map or a record, then even if the map has complex keys, accessing
                        them won't be related to the fieldnames of the record case. *)

    (** Given field shapes, a particular shape, a maximal width, a maximal search depth and a
        boolean indicating that cycles should not be traversed, traverses the field shapes table and
        builds the field paths obtained by recursively adding all the defined fieldnames of the
        considered shape to the prefixes.

        The traversal building a field path will stop when the maximal search depth has been
        reached, a shape with more than [LineageConfig.field_width] fields is encountered, or a
        shape that has already been traversed is encountered and [LineageConfig.prevent_cycles] is
        true.

        When the building of a field path stops, the folding function [f] will be called on the path
        built so far.

        Note that the traversal and the calling of [f] is done from the original argument shape: for
        instance, if [X] has the field [X#foo#bar#baz], the depth limit is 2 and this function is
        called from the shape of [X#foo], then [f] will be called with the field path [bar#baz] --
        even if [X#foo] and [X#bar#baz] have the same shape, or [X] has a thousand other fields. For
        this reason, [~max_search_depth] is an explicit parameter, different from the
        {!LineageConfig.field_depth} configuration option.

        The typical use-case is to then have [f] call {!finalise}, with [X#foo] in the parameters,
        which will repeat a similar traversal to only yield [X#foo#bar] as a final field path. This
        allows implementing {!fold_cell_pairs} by first getting the candidate final fields from a
        common shape of two different origin paths, then finalising separately wrt. these two paths
        (which could have different depths to begin with). *)
